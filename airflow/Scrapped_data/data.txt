What's happening?

As I mentioned earlier, JetBrains, which is a leading company in developing intelligent tools for software developers and project managers, especially famous for its IDEs for different programming languages, has decided to make a few more of its IDEs free for non-commercial use.

This decision seems a bit weird since JetBrains's income from its IDEs mostly comes from selling commercial licensing.
